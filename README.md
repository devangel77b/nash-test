# nash-test
### Mack Nash and D Evangelista
This is a test of using Git and Github repository for revision control of robot football code for USNA 2020.

## Cloning the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devangel77b/nash-test
```

## Workflow
Say Nash wants to grab the most recent code, add a blinking LED to it, and then push the working and debugged result back to the repository for others to use. 
```bash
git pull
(then make your edits)
git add (whatever files changed)
git commit -m "Enter what you'd like here"
git push
```

## How to tag etc
Use case: Fill in later but we want to tag specific revisions so we can go to them. Say MC is working on code but it's not working right and she wants to go back to an earlier version.. 

## Branches
Use case: Fill in later. Say Steffey wants to work on feature X. Steffey will pull the most recent, then create a branch for her stuff and work within that branch until she is happy. When she is done, she will let Nash know and ask him to pull changes from her branch into the master or dev branches as appropriate.
